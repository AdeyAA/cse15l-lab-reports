For this step, I used the `CTRL-R` command and then pressed `<tab>` to complete the line `ssh aaali@ieng6.ucsd.edu` in the terminal then pressed `<enter>`.



# Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

-I copied the ssh url from GitHub using `CTRL-C` then just typed `git clone` then used `CTRL-P` then `<enter>`.

-I used the command `CTRL-R` to complete the line `vim ListExamples.java` and pressed `<enter>` then used the keys `k` `j` `l` `h` to find the spot with the error. Then I used the 'x' key to delete the number 1 then I used the key `i` to insert the number 2 where the number 1 previously was. After that, I used the `esc` key to go back to normal mode then used the command `:wq!` to save the changes in `ListExamples.java` and pressed `<enter>`.



# Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

- For this step, I just used the upward key until I found `bash test.sh` again and pressed `<enter>`.


# Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

-To add the changed commit and push the changes to Github I used the `CTRL-R` for all of these steps until the command I was looking for was semi auto-completed then used the `<tab>` key then pressed `<enter>`.
